"""Post-detection box refinement utilities.

These helpers run *after* a detector (e.g. YOLO) has produced bounding boxes.
They look at the actual ink in the image to fix boxes that under-shoot the
text line, without changing the detector's interface.

Only ``cv2`` + ``numpy`` are used so this stays cheap and dependency-light.

    ----------
    img_bgr : np.ndarray
        BGR image the boxes were detected on.
    boxes : list of (x1, y1, x2, y2)
        Text boxes to refine (caller should exclude non-text such as logos).
    gap_ratio : float
        Maximum horizontal gap to bridge, as a fraction of the box height.
        Larger values cover wider word spacing; too large merges columns.
    min_area_ratio : float
        Ink components smaller than ``min_area_ratio * box_height**2`` are
        ignored as noise.
    pad : int
        Horizontal padding applied after expansion.
    contain_ratio : float
        Minimum fraction of a component's height that must fall inside the line
        band for it to count as line text. Rejects photos/graphics that extend
        well above/below the band (their contained fraction is low).
    max_height_ratio : float
